Model is unsuitably constrained (i.e. there were still some variables left to be computed, and some unusable equations left over).
At the time of the error, the following variables were found:
 * Defined: time in component main in model ./tests/test_xml/underconstrained_1.xml
 * Defined: offset in component main in model ./tests/test_xml/underconstrained_1.xml
 * Defined: x in component main in model ./tests/test_xml/underconstrained_1.xml
 * Defined: y in component main in model ./tests/test_xml/underconstrained_1.xml
 * Defined: z in component main in model ./tests/test_xml/underconstrained_1.xml
 * Undefined: extra in component main in model ./tests/test_xml/underconstrained_1.xml
 * Undefined: d/dt y in component main in model ./tests/test_xml/underconstrained_1.xml
The following equations couldn't be used:
 * Equation with no id on the apply or math element.
