  New in CppUnit 1.12.1:
  ----------------------

* Assertion:

  - CPPUNIT_ASSERT_DOUBLES_EQUAL() now properly handles non-finite
    values, specifically NaN, +Inf, and -Inf.

* Portability:

  - Fixed some compilation issue for QtTestRunner.
  - Code should build on Windows in UNICODE mode.

  New in CppUnit 1.12.0:
  ----------------------

* Portability:

  - autogen.sh can now be run on Mac OS X (patch #1449380
    contributed by Sander Temme).

* MFC Test runner:

  - fixed bug #1498175: double click on failure would sometime
    not goto failed assertion in visual studio.

* Documentation:

  - now generated with doxygen 1.4.7 new 'tabs' style.


  New in CppUnit 1.11.4:
  ----------------------


* Portability:

  - Support for Embedded Visual C++ 4 added. For this purpose, CppUnit now
    provides a very simple stream implementation if none is provided.
    This should also help porting on other platforms which have STL but
    no stream support. Just make sure that CPPUNIT_NO_STREAM is defined
    to 1 in your config header.

* Assertion:

  - Added missing _MESSAGE variants for the following assertions:

    CPPUNIT_ASSERT_DOUBLES_EQUAL_MESSAGE
    CPPUNIT_ASSERT_THROW_MESSAGE
    CPPUNIT_ASSERT_NO_THROW_MESSAGE
    CPPUNIT_ASSERT_ASSERTION_FAIL_MESSAGE
    CPPUNIT_ASSERT_ASSERTION_PASS_MESSAGE

    Notes: change made to CPPUNIT_ASSERT_THROW may cause compilation error
    if you're expecting std::exception as it would be caught twice. Contact us
    if it is an issue (we don't see much use for such a test).

    Some assertions failure message are now more detailed (exception,
    expression).
    Thanks to Neil Ferguson who contributed this patch.

  - Assertion on real number now output expected and actual value using the
    maximum available precision instead of the previous strategy of rounding
    to 6 digits.

    Thanks to Neil Ferguson who contributed this patch.

* Outputter:

  - XML Ouputter: patch #997006 contributed by Akos Maroy makes the
    'stand-alone' attribute of the XML header optional.
    See XmlOutputter::setStandalone() & XmlDocument::setStandalone().

  - Better integration of compiler output for gcc on Mac OS X with Xcode
    (contributed by Claus Broch).

* MFC Test Runner

  - Integration with VC++ 7.0 & 7.1. Double clicking on a failure will now
    to the failure location in the open IDE (no add-in necessary).
    This was contributed by Max Quatember and Andreas Pfaffenbichler.

  - Progress bar: now use system color to draw border
    (patch from bug #1165875 contributed by Pieter Van Dyck).

* QT Test Runner

  - Fixed display of multi-line messages (patch contributed by Karol Szkudlarek).

* Compilation:

  - The standard pkg-config file is now generated on unix (contributed by
    Robert Leight).

  - MinGW: patch #1024428 contributed by astar, fixed compilation issue in
    Win32DynamicLibraryManager.cpp.

  - MinGW, cygwin: enable build of shared library when using libtool.
