Installation Instructions
*************************

You need CMake to build the CellML API.

On POSIX platforms, you can run:
  cmake -LA .
to see the options available to you, or if you have ccmake installed and
prefer a curses-based UI to select options and generate makefiles:
  ccmake .

After generating makefiles with CMake, you can run:
  make all
  make test
  make install
to build and install the CellML API.

On Windows (when building with MSVC2010), when running CMake, add
  -G "NMake Makefiles" to the CMake command line,
and then run:
  nmake all
  nmake test
  nmake install

To build using MSYS and MinGW on Windows, add
  -G "MSYS Makefiles" to the CMake command line,
and then run
  make all
  make test
  make install
