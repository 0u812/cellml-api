\section cplusplus_demo A basic C++ program using the API

\include MyExample.cpp

This can be compiled and run on a *nix system as follows (where $CELLML_SDK is the path to the SDK directory or your install prefix):
\verbatim
export CELLML_SDK=path/to/cellml-sdk
g++ -I$CELLML_SDK/include -L$CELLML_SDK/lib -lcellml ./MyTest.cpp -o MyTest
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CELLML_SDK/lib ./MyTest
\endverbatim

Note: When linking on Windows with Visual C++, it is normal to see the following compiler warnings, due to the coding style of the CellML API: warning C4290 and warning C4091. Neither of these warnings represent a real problem with the API; you can suppress them by giving MSVC the "/wd4290" and "/wd4091" flags.
